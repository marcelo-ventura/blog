#Beginning

As a crypto investor and enthusiast, I'd be unhappy to not study and analyze its market.

After finishing this [work](https://repositorio.bc.ufg.br/tede/handle/tede/8278), I was very tired and wanted to do a quick project which could make me happy. So I called a friend in Rio and invited him to make a project submission to the annual excellent event [SER](https://ser2018.weebly.com) (International Seminar of Statistics with R) which is hosted and created by UFF (Universidade Federal Fluminense).

He replied me and we talked about mutual interests among cryptos, and we've decided to work on a Poster submission about Crypto modeling.

Despite all limitations (including page limits) and the [distance](https://www.google.com.br/maps/dir/Bras%C3%ADlia,+DF/Rio+de+Janeiro,+RJ/@-19.5881066,-47.9336868,7z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m14!4m13!1m5!1m1!1s0x935a3d18df9ae275:0x738470e469754a24!2m2!1d-47.8821658!2d-15.7942287!1m5!1m1!1s0x9bde559108a05b:0x50dc426c672fd24e!2m2!1d-43.1728965!2d-22.9068467!3e3) between Rio and Bras√≠lia we finished everything in 5 days.

#Everything

"Everything" was possible only because of [coinmarketcap](https://coinmarketcap.com) excellent website. This is a really interesting way to find crypto data.

Back to our idea...we focused on main two subtopics: data mining and crypto modeling. We've found a nice approach given by this [Python](https://dashee87.github.io/deep%20learning/python/predicting-cryptocurrency-prices-with-deep-learning/) solution.

The objective was to create a framework where 5 cryptocoins were modeled, and its regressions were compared. How?

#Method

Our regression model was based on the Generalized Hyperbolic distribution, see [this](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&ved=2ahUKEwjAnP2u_ZDdAhXLhJAKHUKUAk0QFjAAegQICBAC&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.mdpi.com%2F1911-8074%2F10%2F2%2F12%2Fpdf&usg=AOvVaw1R1v2AKZpYL0fx60qlhZix).
